# Cloning and Running a Repository on macOS

This guide outlines the steps for macOS users to clone a repository from GitHub and run it on their computer using Bash commands.

## 1. Install Git

Ensure that Git is installed on your macOS system. You can install it using Homebrew or download the installer from the official Git website:

# Code Overview

- The maze is represented as a 2D array with zeros indicating empty spaces.
- The circle is represented by a red circle patch in the Matplotlib plot.
- The `update` function generates random steps for the circle's movement and updates its position accordingly.
- The animation is created using `FuncAnimation` from Matplotlib.

## 2. Clone the Repository
To clone the repository, use the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mahsarnzh/Monte_Carlo_Probability_Decision_Making.git
```


```
# If using Homebrew
brew install git
```

# Random Walk in a Maze Animation

This Python script generates an animated random walk of a circle in a maze using Matplotlib. The circle starts at a specified position in the maze and takes random steps (up, down, left, or right) at each frame.
