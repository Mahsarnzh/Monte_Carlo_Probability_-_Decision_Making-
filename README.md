# Code Overview

- The maze is represented as a 2D array with zeros indicating empty spaces.
- The circle is represented by a red circle patch in the Matplotlib plot.
- The `update` function generates random steps for the circle's movement and updates its position accordingly.
- The animation is created using `FuncAnimation` from Matplotlib.

# Random Walk in a Maze Animation
This Python script generates an animated random walk of a circle in a maze using Matplotlib. The circle starts at a specified position in the maze and takes random steps (up, down, left, or right) at each frame.
